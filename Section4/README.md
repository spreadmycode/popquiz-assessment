The MTCT Unit Trust Company intends to integrate Web3 Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and Verifiable Credentials (VC) to support customer onboarding, asset management, and offboarding processes. The integration with WeIDY will handle onboarding and user management credentialing. The system will extend to support on-premise and cloud-native deployment but geared more towards cloud workload. The architecture must capture the core principles of a well-architected design, supporting maintainability, scalability, and reliability. The system design will integrate with Web3 Verifiable Credentials called WeIDY.

System Architecture:
The proposed system architecture design consists of four main components:

- Web3 Blockchain Layer
- Microservices Backend Layer
- User Interface Layer
- WeIDY Verifiable Credentials

Overall Architecture:
The proposed architecture for the integration between the applications in Sections 2 and 3 consists of three main layers: the Web3 blockchain layer, the microservices backend layer, and the interfaces layer. The Web3 blockchain layer includes the Ethereum network, on which the WeIDY system for self-sovereign identity management will be built. The microservices backend layer includes various microservices responsible for customer onboarding, asset management, and offboarding processes, as well as the integration with the Web3 blockchain layer. The interfaces layer includes various interfaces, including the Investor Portal, through which investors can access the system.

- Web3 Blockchain Layer:
  The Web3 blockchain layer is responsible for providing a decentralized and secure platform for managing self-sovereign identity using verifiable credentials. The Ethereum network will be used to deploy the WeIDY system, which will handle the onboarding and user management credentialing for the MTCT Unit Trust company. WeIDY will be built using open-source libraries such as Aries and Indy, which provide a standard framework for self-sovereign identity management.

- Microservices Backend Layer:
  The microservices backend layer is responsible for handling the business processes of customer onboarding, asset management, and offboarding. The layer includes various microservices, including the KYC service, asset management service, sales transaction service, and investor portal service. These microservices will be built using modern technologies such as Node.js, Python, and Go, and will be designed to be scalable, maintainable, and reliable.
  The KYC service will be responsible for collecting and verifying customer information and issuing verifiable credentials to the customers. The asset management service will be responsible for managing the financial assets of the investors, including creating and updating new financial asset products. The sales transaction service will be responsible for handling the sales transactions of the investors, including buying and selling financial assets. The investor portal service will provide an interface for investors to access the system and perform various tasks, including viewing their asset portfolio, buying and selling financial assets, and updating their profile information.

- Interfaces Layer:
  The interfaces layer provides various interfaces for users to interact with the system, including the Investor Portal. The Investor Portal will be a web-based application built using modern web technologies such as React.js and will be designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. The Investor Portal will provide various functionalities, including viewing asset portfolios, buying and selling financial assets, updating profile information, and managing verifiable credentials.

Conclusion:
The proposed system design and architecture for the integration between the applications in Sections 2 and 3 provides a scalable, maintainable, and reliable solution for customer onboarding, asset management, and offboarding. The integration with the Web3 blockchain layer and the use of verifiable credentials for self-sovereign identity management provide a secure and decentralized solution for managing customer data. The microservices backend layer provides a modular and scalable architecture for handling various business processes, and the interfaces layer provides a user-friendly interface for investors to interact with the system.
